ML Model Perdiction - Project By Erez Levy
Project Overview: The TMDB Dataset Guiding Questions:

1. What are we trying to find out?
   
We aim to build a predictive model to determine the success of a TV show based on features such as vote count, vote average, and popularity.
This project will analyze key factors that contribute to a show's success and develop machine learning models for prediction.

2. What do we already know?

The TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset provides extensive data on 150,000 TV shows, including ratings, genres, production details, and popularity metrics. Prior research suggests that vote count, vote average, and popularity are strong indicators of a show's success.

3. What are we aiming to achieve?
  
Success is defined by the creation of an accurate, well-validated machine learning model that can predict a TV show's success based on selected features. The insights gained will support better content recommendations and decision-making for stakeholders.

4. What factors affect our results?
  
Data quality and completeness Feature selection (e.g., number of seasons, episodes, production company, language) Model selection and hyperparameter tuning Handling of missing data and outliers Balancing the dataset if needed.

5. Is there something new we can use?
   
Advanced machine learning models such as Gradient Boosting and Random Forest for better predictions Feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy Sentiment analysis from show descriptions to add another predictive element Project Stages Overview:

1. Data Preparation Clean and preprocess TMDB dataset. Merge relevant tables and remove unnecessary columns. Standardize numerical features and handle missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualize trends in TV show popularity, ratings, and genres. Analyze correlations between show features and success metrics.
3. Data Cleansing Identify and handle outliers and missing data. Reduce highly imbalanced categories.
4. One-Hot Encoding Convert categorical data (e.g., genres, languages, production companies) into numerical format.
5. Feature EngineeringExtract additional features such as episode duration and creator influence. Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) if needed.
6. Imbalanced Data Handling Use oversampling or undersampling techniques if certain success categories are underrepresented.   
7. Model Selection and Fine-Tuning Compare regression models:
    Linear Regression (baseline model) Random Forest Regressor (captures non-linear relationships) Gradient Boosting Regressor (high-performance model).
    Train and evaluate models using R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
    Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
   
Project Summary:
Deployment and Beneficiaries of Machine Learning.
1. How will we deploy the Machine Learning?

   The final model will be deployed as a web API or integrated into an analytical dashboard for stakeholders. Possible deployment through cloud platforms such as AWS or 
    Google Cloud for real-time predictions.
   
2. Who will use and benefit from the Machine Learning?

   Streaming platforms and content producers: Gain insights into factors driving TV show success.
   Marketers and advertisers: Improve targeted campaigns based on expected popularity trends.
   Viewers and recommendation systems: Enhance personalized recommendations based on predicted success.

   This project aims to provide actionable insights and predictive capabilities that can assist various stakeholders in making data-driven decisions regarding TV show 
   production, marketing, and content recommendations.
